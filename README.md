# onion-ghost-blog

Set up secret [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) blog on the [Tor network](https://www.torproject.org/) in under a two minutes.

## What?

This uses ansible (a piece of software specifically for provisioning servers) to configure a Digital Ocean Ghost image for use on the Tor network.

This is based on a the [I Will Follow You into The Dark[net] presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A-0bggHr8fk0_UJhm251-GfyYShU0II3KNRDt9-uzjU) given at [Radical Networks 2015](http://radicalnetworks.org/) by [@carolinesinders](http://twitter.com/@carolinesinders), [@corcra](http://twitter.com/@corcra), and [@huertanix](http://twitter.com/@huertanix).

## Usage


1. Install [`ansible`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html). On OS X,

   ```bash
   $ brew install ansible
   ```

   For other operating systems [follow the instructions on the ansible site](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html).

1. Use [Digital Ocean](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new) to spin up a new server pre-imaged with Ghost

   Make sure to associate your SSH key with it (my computer is called "Unicron")
